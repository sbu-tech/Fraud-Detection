Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning
This project is a fraud detection model that identifies fraudulent transactions in a dataset using machine learning techniques. The goal is to classify transactions as either "fraud" or "non-fraud" based on various transaction features.

Project Overview
Financial fraud is a major challenge, and early detection can save millions. This project leverages machine learning algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions by analyzing patterns in transaction data.The project includes data preprocessing, class balancing techniques, model training, evaluation, and visualization.\
